<h1 align="center">Lesson-End Project: Smart Contract for Banking Application</h1>

This repository contains a simple Solidity-based smart contract for basic banking functionalities. It was developed as an end-of-lesson project during the Blockchain Developer Training course.

## Description

The SimpleBankingContract project is a demonstration of a basic banking contract implemented in Solidity. It allows users to deposit funds, withdraw funds, and check their account balances. The contract includes necessary checks and validations to ensure the security and integrity of the banking operations.

## Changes Made

The provided code has been modified to align with current industry standards and best practices in the blockchain development market. Several changes were made to improve efficiency, security, and readability of the contract. These changes include:

- Updated Solidity version to 0.8.0 for better gas optimizations and language enhancements.
- Added event emission for the LogDepositMade event within the deposit function to provide transparency and enable external systems to listen for deposit events.
- Enhanced error handling by providing informative error messages for failed transactions.
- Implemented access control modifiers to restrict access to certain functions or variables (if applicable).

## Efficiency Improvements

The modified code incorporates various efficiency improvements. Some notable statistics include:

- Gas optimizations from using Solidity version 0.8.0, resulting in reduced gas costs for contract deployment and execution.
- Enhanced gas efficiency through optimized storage and function implementations.
- Improved contract functionality and security with added error handling and access control measures.
